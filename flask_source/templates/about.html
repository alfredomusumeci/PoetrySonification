    <h1>{% block title %} About this project {% endblock %}</h1>
    <p> This website was built as part of Alfredo Musumeci's dissertation about Data Sonification.
    Its purpose is to show the possibility of converting written data, such as text, into music.
    The conversion relies on a Deep Neural Network which has been trained on hundreds of songs for
    the purpose of extracting sentiment from words interdependecy. </p>
